Acquiring 'fluency' in any language means not having to translate in your head before you speak or write. I don't know about you, but keeping the meanings of 

```
.unshift    .push    .shift    .pop 
```

straight in my head was really difficult at the start. I had to stop and think for the longest time which one meant which action when adding or removing items from an array. It really made me frustrated when I had to constantly look up the usage of these methods. 

So I made a little picture to help me, once I got my bearings and told myself a few stories (see below). I'm a very visual learner so a picture is worth it's weight in gold if it makes me remember something.

The random, and far from perfect, narratives are as follows:

**For adding items **

In the front:

* You need to "unshift" (I'm thinking capitalization) the current capitalized item (think "word") since it's no longer at the beginning of the "sentence", it's now going to be in second place. 

At the end:

* ".push it on" to the array

**For removing items**

In the front:
* (As long as I remember the .unshift rule is to add, I know .shift is to remove)

At the end:
* ".pop off" is easy to remember

A picture, along with a few key phrases, can really help to commit something to long term memory. 

As with most tricks that help you out when learning something new, it's only a matter of time until they are no longer necessary.  The easier you can make their recall - without looking at a book or notes - the sooner they will become a part of your fluency.
