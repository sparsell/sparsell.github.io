I've had to dig deep over the past few weeks. Trying to find the time - and the QUIET space - that I need in order to learn how to code has been a ridiculous challenge while in quarantine.  I know we're all in the same boat. 

Stuck on the same lab for over a week, I took a litte time to reflect on my frustration this past Sunday, Mother's Day. 

Ever since having kids, I've been a master at squeezing minutes out of my day: to get "more" done, to start something new or even just to find efficiency for mundane, repetitive tasks (yes, I am the authority in my house when it comes to how to optimally load the dishwasher). 

My motto has been: you have more time than you think you do. I already don't watch TV or Netflix or anything regularly. I am laser-focused on how I spend my time and know exactly "what" is best done "when" throughout my day. But this? This quarantine has thrown my routine on its head and I am devastated to report it is now dead.

 So, I'm back to the drawing board.  My son needs me during his school hours so my prime "mentally alert" hours are now devoted to keeping him on track, resolving IT issues and getting him through the day. I've never been able to study effectively in the afternoon but it has become a 'needs must" situation. 
 
 I'm looking at ways to get my head into a good mental space in the middle of the afternoon.  Is it an inspiring quote? A mantra? A song? 
 
 Here's what I found for today, after a quick look through all the notes I take while reading books: 
 
 "If you're serious about chaning your life, you'll find a way.  If not, you'll find an excuse." 
 - J. Sincero from  her book "You Are A Badass"

Bingo. I'm so serious about becoming a software engineer. This morning, during my most productive study hours of the day (5-7AM), I gave myself a quick talking to about whining like a victim instead of embracing the change and making it work.  After al, I still have exactly the same number of hours in my day. 

BTW - here's me committing now, that the next post I write will be to summarize all I have learned about the glorious Collaborating Objects section which has taken me way to long to get through.
