I recently started studying software engineering online at the Flatiron School. I'm not an absolute "newbie": I've been dabbling in self-directed learning for over four years. I was looking for a program that could help refine the skills I've acquired thus far, and help me get across the "finish line" of ultimately finding a job.  

This is a second career for me, although I'm having a great time reflecting on how this could have been the first choice many years ago, had I seen the trees for the woods at an early age (anyone remember ASVAB testing as a Junior in high school?).  

I wrote about some of the obvious times in my life that I could have jumped on this software engineering road a lot sooner than now on Dev.to, which you can read [here](http://dev.to/sparsell/nevertheless-sonja-somehow-managed-to-keep-showing-up-4j6i).

What ultimately got me to Flatiron, however, wasn't the free cofffee at Codeland, the amazing 'Women Take Tech' scholarship I was fortunate enough to receive, or the way they made me feel like I can "do this" and at any age (well, maybe it was a bit of that).

What got me to enroll in a bootcamp is how excited I get when I think of what I can change/be a part of: 

* The way my kids see me --> from a stay at home mom to a software engineer!
* The way the world will come to value flexible work --> I can do this from anywhere!
* The way I can contribute --> ideas for tech to help those around me in need that I can actually create!

I know I can get better and eventually be great at this - coding, developing, writing a blog (!) - and I know I can spend the next 25 years of my life creating technology to make a difference.
