The educational journey that got me to where I am today, required a lot of personal reflection. I was intrigued by the popular MOOC “Learning to Learn” by Dr. Barbara Oakley, and various other books, that demonstrated the importance of being a lifelong learner. And the “how”... Up until then, I didn’t know my learning skills were so out of date. (More on that in a different post.) 

To cut to the point, there are a few things I’ve implemented in my studying that have made a huge difference in how well I master a concept and how well I retain it. In starting to learn Ruby, I’ve found a rhythm that is really helping me to get the most out of solving my labs. 

****	Read it.****

Especially with new material, I’ve never been able to retain and apply content without a few read throughs. I’ve also found that looking at several different resources about the same topic help to bring clarity. I love books for reference, articles online, blog posts by fellow students or online courses/books. Every repetition presents it in a new light and eventually, the dust settles and the concept materializes. 

**Write it.**

I’ve always been a copious note taker. (Admittedly, it could have a lot to do with my love of notebooks and pens.) Without looking for confirmation bias to continue my stockpiling of Fringe notepads and Pilot pens, it’s now a well-known proven fact that writing things down makes us remember them better. 

I took it one step further and created a Google doc as well, since coding muscle memory is all about learning the correct syntax. You need to practice!  


**	Repl.it**

This has been my favorite new tool. Early on as a student at Flatiron, I noticed a subtle feeling of just wanting to get the lab to pass in order to stay “on schedule”. But by the time I got to more complicated labs, I knew I probably didn’t take as much time as I should have to fully understand earlier concepts.  

I started using Repl.it religiously. I set it up with the requirements from the lab, created many collections of data (arrays, hashes, etc.) so that I could turn them “on/off” depending on what I was testing. Starting off with the simplest requirement in the lab was a great way to gain confidence and really look at how everything worked.  Or didn’t work!  My notes have just as many comments about what I did wrong so I don’t do it again.  


**Remember it!**

I’m happy to say I’ve started to enjoy the journey even more now that I have a process.  The “becoming” part of becoming a software engineer isn't something I want to wish away.
