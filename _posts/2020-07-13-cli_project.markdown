I recently completed my first project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering program.  Getting through this felt like a huge achievement and I knew it would provide me with a lot of motivation to keep moving ahead, one day at a time. 

I started preparing for the project while I was still completing the Object Oriented section of the curriculum as I wanted to allow myself a lot of time to think about what it would do and how I would execute it. (I know myself well!)

### What helped to get started

#### Attend Study Groups

I attended many Study Groups and watched all the videos I could find on Learn.co well BEFORE I had my idea, which was really helpful.  It gave me a really good idea as to what I needed to build (AKA requirements) and how I wanted to do it (scraping v. API).  Which brings me to...

#### API or scrape? JUST PICK ONE 

Eventually I decided on scraping. Then using an API. Then scraping again. Then a different API. Then I found some data I am PASSIONATE about and it had an API so changed my mind one last time.  So much for my early start to the project. (By this time, I had scraping and reading API documentation down pat so I'm not going to see it as "wasting time" but as taking the time to learn new things and practice extracting data in many different ways.)

Part of my indecision is that I was trying to prove to myself that I could solve a huge problem, rather than just use this project to exercise and showcase what I have learned so far. In hindsight, I would have just started with my passion and stuck with it instead of going back and forth. (If you're just starting out, it's great to pick something you are interested in, of course, but don't worry if it doesn't become anything other than a completed project - one of the hundreds you are going to make in your life as a developer.)

#### Join the slack channel

- The CLI channel was really helpful in getting other students' advice. Everyone is very helpful and they're either going through what you are or they have just been through it so it's the best place to go first. (After Google, of course.)

### What worked for me

As I mentioned in at the start of this post: Do not over think the purpose. I was looking for the perfect, most meaningful topic to me when I should have just picked one and gotten started. Assume there will be twists and turns that you will have to deal with on any API or scraping site no matter which you choose.

#### Do the next right thing

I started using a system with “Post its” which helped me focus and make progress  - especially when it felt overwhelming to get started. I wrote out the single next step to do and stuck it on my computer and then held myself accountable to that one task until it was done. 

In my super scrappy schedule for coding these days, when everyone (husband and two children ages 8 and 10) is home and needs my attention it seems, I never know how much time I'll have or when I'll have it.  This system really helped me to solve the next thing and not get so distracted or overwhelmed. I knew exactly where to start whenever I sat down and really felt a lot better about my progress as I saw the little notes accumulate in the 'finished' pile. 

#### Just make the mvp

Always go for something that works and add features later.  

#### Get friendly with pry and github

I have to admit, pry was a bit of a mystery to me up until this point. And now, whoa, I totally appreciate its power. It makes sense to really master what it's telling you and how to use it. Same for git/github. I have always loved git and github so making myself use it every day - everything was committed with relative comments several times a day - was unfamiliar at first but became really powerful later on. I even used different branches on my desktop v. my laptop to be able practice merging. This may have been extra work in terms of this project, but it did come in handy when I wanted to try different things with some methods without having to have lots of commented out code in my files. I kept my thought processes clear by using different branches. 

#### Don't compare yourself to others

So hard, I know. If I’m learning anything about becoming a software engineer in the current state of the world, it’s to not hold myself to someone else’s schedule or progress. It's really disheartening, of course, to see others that started around the time I did, pass me by and work faster but I'm doing the best to compare myself to me yesterday, or last year.  Not to fellow classmates. (But yes, it's so hard not to!)
