I'll be the first to admit: I'm not crazy about my project this time around, which made it much harder to finish, unfortunately.  However, it also provided me with some excellent experience in persistence.


## Requirements are hard
As with every project so far at Flatiron, I've struggled with making my idea "fit" the requirements. Good practice for real life, I know, but some days I just wanted to build it the way I wanted to build it. I had a great first idea to start, but really couldn't make the relationships work the way it made sense to me so moved on to idea number two. I should have kept moving, because I think idea number three would have been the best. (I guess I will save that one for something to keep me occupied while looking for a job once I finish.) 

The silver lining in this case is that those requirements really made me think about how Rails works and gives me a taste for software architecting. By the time I finished my MVP, I wanted to start another project in order to really cement what I had learned. I definitely learn best by repitition. 

## Keeping your momentum is harder

After a long break over the holidays (with my kids home from school, it became impossible to keep up the pace I had pre-Thanksgiving), I realized I needed to go back to the beginning with Rails and spent a few days looking solely at Active Record Associations. I had done something like this before, when I was learing Ruby basics last March (and all of a sudden everyone was home all the time). Every time I have taken a step back from "progress", it has always been worth it in terms of the increase in my understanding what it is I am studying. 

I have quite a few months before my time in the program is officialy over, but I started to panic when I was struggling with my Rails project. I had a great call with an educational coach who reminded me of the MVP. I realized I was trying to make my project ready for public use, when really, the knowledge I had demonstrated throught what I had already built was likely more than enough to get me to the finish line. 

Now I have a bright pink sticker near my screen that says "MPV". 

## Staying calm is hardest

Throughout the progress of learning about Rails and then applying it to my project, I kept reminding myself of this great phrase I read on a fellow stundent's blog: "It's not complicated, it's just unfamiliar".
